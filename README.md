# React Info Site

A react site built during Scrimba React course.

Most of the code is built by me during the course.

## Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
```

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```
